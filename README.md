##0x1D. C - Binary trees

Binary trees can be built in the C programming language by utilizing
pointers to connect the nodes and structures to specify the nodes.

Binary trees are a type of hierarchical data structure consisting of
 nodes, with the left and right children being the maximum number of
children that each node can have. The highest node in the tree is
referred to as the root, and edges or links bind it to its offspring. 
Every node has the option of being a leaf node with no children or 
having references to its offspring nodes.
